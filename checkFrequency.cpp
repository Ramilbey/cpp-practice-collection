// 4.Write a C++ program to apply a recursive function to calculate the frequencies of all numbers in a one-dimensional array. Generate random numbers between 0 and 30 into an array size of 30. Provide the complexity of your code in terms of big Oh notation. 
// Steps:
// a.Assign random numbers to the array
// b.Calculate the frequency of all numbers in the array
// c.Store the frequencies of all numbers
// d.Sort the frequencies from smallest to largest.
// e.Display every number and its frequency.
