# C++ Practice Programs

This repository is a comprehensive collection of C++ programs that demonstrate fundamental programming techniques, algorithm implementations, and data structure.
Each file focuses on a specific concept or problem, making this a practical resource for revision, self-study, and <strong> technical interview preparation.</strong>

## üìÅ Repository Structure

| File Name                        | Description |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| `main.cpp`                       | Demonstrates how to create and work with two-dimensional arrays. Calculates sum of rows and columns. |
| `Fibonacci.cpp`, `FibinachiLoop.cpp` | Recursive and iterative implementations of the Fibonacci sequence. |
| `FactorialRecursiveFunction.cpp` | Calculates factorial using recursion. |
| `PrintRecursive.cpp`             | Demonstrates recursive printing of numbers. |
| `binarySearch.cpp`               | Implements binary search on a sorted array. |
| `seqSearch.cpp`                  | Implements sequential (linear) search. |
| `mergedArray.cpp`               | Merges two arrays into one. |
| `Power.cpp`                      | Computes a number raised to a power. |
| `volume.cpp`                     | Calculates volume (of a cube or cylinder, etc. depending on input). |
| `date.cpp`                       | Handles basic date input/output. |
| `test.cpp`                       | General testing file ‚Äì often used for quick trials. |
| `date.exe`                       | Compiled binary file (can be removed or added to `.gitignore`). |
