# C++ Programming Practice Repository

This repository contains a curated collection of C++ programs that cover a wide range of fundamental concepts in programming and computer science. It includes hands-on implementations of arrays, recursion, searching algorithms, loops, mathematical computations, and more.

The code is organized in standalone files, making it easy to browse, run, and understand each concept individually. This repository serves both as a learning tool and a reference for beginners and intermediate learners in C++.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

| File Name                        | Description |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| `main.cpp`                       | Demonstrates how to create and work with two-dimensional arrays. Calculates sum of rows and columns. |
| `Fibonacci.cpp`, `FibinachiLoop.cpp` | Recursive and iterative implementations of the Fibonacci sequence. |
| `FactorialRecursiveFunction.cpp` | Calculates factorial using recursion. |
| `PrintRecursive.cpp`             | Demonstrates recursive printing of numbers. |
| `binarySearch.cpp`               | Implements binary search on a sorted array. |
| `seqSearch.cpp`                  | Implements sequential (linear) search. |
| `mergedArray.cpp`               | Merges two arrays into one. |
| `Power.cpp`                      | Computes a number raised to a power. |
| `volume.cpp`                     | Calculates volume (of a cube or cylinder, etc. depending on input). |
| `date.cpp`                       | Handles basic date input/output. |
| `test.cpp`                       | General testing file ‚Äì often used for quick trials. |
| `date.exe`                       | Compiled binary file (can be removed or added to `.gitignore`). |
